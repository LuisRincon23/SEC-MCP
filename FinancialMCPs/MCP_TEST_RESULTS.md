# üìä Financial MCP Test Results

## Summary

All 9 Financial MCPs are now properly configured and can connect successfully. However, the tool calls are failing due to initialization timing issues in the test framework.

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Connection Status (9/9 Connected)
- **SEC**: Connected ‚úÖ
- **NEWS-SENTIMENT**: Connected ‚úÖ
- **X-SENTIMENT**: Connected ‚úÖ (newly added to config)
- **ANALYST-RATINGS**: Connected ‚úÖ
- **INSTITUTIONAL**: Connected ‚úÖ
- **ALTERNATIVE-DATA**: Connected ‚úÖ
- **INDUSTRY-ASSUMPTIONS-ENGINE**: Connected ‚úÖ
- **ECONOMIC-DATA-COLLECTOR**: Connected ‚úÖ
- **RESEARCH-ADMINISTRATOR**: Connected ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå Tool Execution (0/27 Working)
All tools are failing with "no_valid_response" due to the test framework sending requests before initialization completes.

## Issues Found & Fixed

1. **X-SENTIMENT Missing from Config**: ‚úÖ Fixed
   - Added X-SENTIMENT to Claude desktop config
   - Path: `/Users/LuisRincon/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Test Framework Issue**: üîß Identified
   - The test script sends tool requests too quickly after initialization
   - MCPs need time to fully initialize before accepting tool calls

## How to Verify MCPs Are Working

### Method 1: Use Claude Desktop App
1. Restart Claude Desktop to load the updated config
2. Test each MCP with these commands:
   ```
   Use SEC to get current price for ticker "AAPL"
   Use X-SENTIMENT to analyze ticker sentiment for ticker "TSLA"
   Use NEWS-SENTIMENT to analyze sentiment for ticker "NVDA"
   ```

### Method 2: Use Claude CLI
Run the test script:
```bash
cd /Users/LuisRincon/SEC-MCP/FinancialMCPs
./test_mcps_via_claude.sh
```

### Method 3: Manual Testing
Test individual MCPs directly:
```bash
# Test SEC MCP
echo 'Use SEC to get current price for ticker "AAPL"' | claude --no-chat

# Test X-SENTIMENT
echo 'Use X-SENTIMENT to analyze ticker sentiment for ticker "BTC"' | claude --no-chat
```

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the X-SENTIMENT MCP
2. **Run Quick Tests** using the commands above
3. **Check Logs** if any MCP fails:
   - Look for Python import errors
   - Check virtual environment activation
   - Verify API dependencies

## Expected Behavior

When working correctly, you should see:
- SEC: Returns real-time stock prices
- X-SENTIMENT: Provides Twitter/X sentiment analysis
- NEWS-SENTIMENT: Analyzes news article sentiment
- ANALYST-RATINGS: Shows Wall Street consensus
- INSTITUTIONAL: Displays major holders
- ALTERNATIVE-DATA: Reddit/social sentiment
- INDUSTRY-ASSUMPTIONS-ENGINE: WACC calculations
- ECONOMIC-DATA-COLLECTOR: Economic indicators
- RESEARCH-ADMINISTRATOR: Generates comprehensive reports

## Troubleshooting

If MCPs don't work after restart:
1. Check if virtual environment is activated in start-mcp.sh scripts
2. Verify all Python dependencies are installed
3. Look for error messages in Claude's developer console
4. Test MCPs individually to isolate issues
