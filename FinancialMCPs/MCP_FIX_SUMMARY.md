# Financial MCPs Fix Summary

## âœ… Changes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Permissions**
- All `start-mcp.sh` scripts now have execute permissions
- This allows Claude Desktop to launch the MCP servers

### 2. **Updated Claude Desktop Configuration**
- Fixed MCP names to match expected format:
  - `SEC-SCRAPER` â†’ `SEC`
  - Added missing MCPs: `INDUSTRY-ASSUMPTIONS-ENGINE`, `ECONOMIC-DATA-COLLECTOR`, `RESEARCH-ADMINISTRATOR`
- All paths are correctly pointing to the start scripts

### 3. **Fixed Session Management Issues**
- Updated 2 files to handle closed sessions properly:
  - `INDUSTRY_ASSUMPTIONS_ENGINE/src/main.py`
  - `ECONOMIC_DATA_COLLECTOR/src/main.py`
- Sessions will now persist between tool calls

### 4. **Verified Dependencies**
- All required Python packages are installed in the virtual environment
- The MCPs use the correct Python interpreter from the venv

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. **Restart Claude Desktop Completely**
- On macOS: Press Cmd+Q to quit Claude Desktop
- Wait a few seconds
- Reopen Claude Desktop from Applications

### 2. **Test the MCPs**
After restarting, test each MCP with these commands in Claude:

```
Use SEC to get current price for ticker "AAPL"
Use NEWS-SENTIMENT to analyze sentiment for ticker "MSFT"
Use ANALYST-RATINGS to get consensus rating for ticker "GOOGL"
Use INSTITUTIONAL to track holdings for ticker "TSLA"
Use ALTERNATIVE-DATA to analyze hiring trends for company "Amazon"
Use INDUSTRY-ASSUMPTIONS-ENGINE to calculate WACC for ticker "META"
Use ECONOMIC-DATA-COLLECTOR to get GDP growth data
Use RESEARCH-ADMINISTRATOR to create research report for ticker "NVDA"
```

### 3. **Monitor for Issues**
If any MCP fails, check the logs:
```bash
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-*.log
```

## ðŸ“‹ What Was Fixed

1. **Permission Issues** - All scripts are now executable
2. **Configuration Naming** - MCP names now match what Claude expects
3. **Session Persistence** - Fixed the "Session is closed" errors
4. **Python Environment** - Verified all dependencies are installed

## âš¡ Quick Test

After restarting Claude Desktop, try this simple test:
```
Use SEC to get current price for ticker "AAPL"
```

If this works, all other MCPs should work as well!

## ðŸ†˜ If Issues Persist

1. Check if Claude Desktop was fully restarted (not just minimized)
2. Verify the config file is valid JSON:
   ```bash
   cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json | python -m json.tool
   ```
3. Look for error messages in the Claude Desktop logs
4. Try testing one MCP at a time to isolate issues

The MCPs are now properly configured and should work correctly with Claude Desktop!
