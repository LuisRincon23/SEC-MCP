### Step 2: Execute the Plan
The Research Administrator will return a plan with specific MCP calls like:
1. Use SEC-SCRAPER's scrape_10k_financials with ticker "NVDA"
2. Use SEC-SCRAPER's get_current_price with ticker "NVDA"
3. Use INDUSTRY-ASSUMPTIONS's generate_full_dcf_assumptions with ticker "NVDA" and industry "technology"
4. Use NEWS-SENTIMENT's get_aggregate_sentiment with ticker "NVDA"
5. Use ANALYST-RATINGS's get_consensus_rating with ticker "NVDA"
6. Use INSTITUTIONAL's track_institutional_changes with ticker "NVDA"

### Step 3: Generate Report Outline
After collecting data:
```
Use RESEARCH-ADMIN's generate_report_outline with:
- ticker: "NVDA"
- collected_data: {
    "sec_data": true,
    "sentiment_data": true,
    "analyst_data": true,
    "institutional_data": true,
    "dcf_data": true
  }
```

### Step 4: Create Executive Summary

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Best Results

1. **Always specify sector** for accurate DCF assumptions

4. **Chain multiple requests** for comparative analysis
5. **Use natural language** for complex requests
